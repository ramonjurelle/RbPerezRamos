## Did We Let the Earth Breathe? ##

Our Earth. Our Home. Everything has a limit, including the planet.  Around April 2022, the topic #LetTheEarthBreathe rose around social media platforms to raise awareness about the climate change in this planet. A trend hoping for a change, hoping for the Earth to Breathe. This website will discuss the main causes of climate change in the world and how we, regardless of age, gender, or status in life, can contribute to make a change, to make a chance to live again.
