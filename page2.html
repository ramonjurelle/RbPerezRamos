  <p> Why is it bad?

Deforestation is the purposely clearing of lands, forests, trees, and plants to convert the area into infrastructures and establishments. This is also a major worldwide problem that is the cause of climate change too caused by human activities. Currently, most occurred cases of deforestation are found in tropical rainforests, including the Philippines.

    How we can help avoid deforestation

A simple thing we can make to help avoiding deforestation is by supporting the empowerment of conservation of the forests from small campaigns to big ones. It is important for us, regardless of gender, age, nationality, and financial status in life, to help the conservation of the forests as it will be us whoâ€™ll benefit too in the future. It is us who started the cause, now we must finish it with a good effect.
