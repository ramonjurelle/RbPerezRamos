  <p> Why is it bad?

Deforestation is the purposely clearing of lands, forests, trees, and plants to convert the area into infrastructures and establishments. This is also a major worldwide problem that is the cause of climate change too caused by human activities. Currently, most occurred cases of deforestation are found in tropical rainforests, including the Philippines.

 <h3> Its Effects on the Environment </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <h4> Soil Erosion </h4> </li>
    <p> A tree’s job is to hold the soil firmly in place. Once trees are removed, this would weaken the soil’s stability. If exposed to strong winds would cause the soil to erode. </p>

    <li> <h4> Flooding </h4> </li>
    <p> One of the functions of trees is to control flooding, Its roots absorb rainwater and if they’re not present, this would cause a dire flood to take place especially in rainy seasons.</p>

    <li> <h4> Climate Change </h4> </li>
    <p> Trees absorbs the carbon dioxide, a harmful gas, that is scattered in the atmosphere. Cutting them down means that the absorbed carbon dioxide would be released into the atmosphere once again. If these gases are released, this would contribute to climate change which would cause a rise in temperature since CO2 radiates heat. If trees are not replanted, the only chance of purifying the air around us would be gone.  </p>

    <li> <h4> Habitat Loss </h4> </li>
    <p> 70% of the land animals live in forests, this provides shelter for them and it also helps in temperature regulation. If these trees are disposed, it would be difficult for the animals to adapt to another environment. If they couldn’t get used to it they would move to a new terrain or die while doing so. </p>
 </ul>
    
    How we can help avoid deforestation

A simple thing we can make to help avoiding deforestation is by supporting the empowerment of conservation of the forests from small campaigns to big ones. It is important for us, regardless of gender, age, nationality, and financial status in life, to help the conservation of the forests as it will be us who’ll benefit too in the future. It is us who started the cause, now we must finish it with a good effect.
