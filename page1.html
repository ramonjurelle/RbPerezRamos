  <h3> How to help on preventing and avoiding Illegal Mining. </h3>
  <p> One thing we can do is identify the areas that would most likely be subjected to illegal mining. Through this, we would know which areas to protect and the government would be able to take the necessary measures for solving this problem. </p>
  
  <p> Another thing that we can do is spread information as well through social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. This can be done by creating infographics, posters, and simple posts, it would be better if the content would not be wordy (since others may find the post dragging). Doing this would give other people a chance to learn the effects of illegal mining and give them the sufficient knowledge that may be used to combat illegal mining in our planet.  </p>
