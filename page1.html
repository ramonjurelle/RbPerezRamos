    <h1> ILLEGAL AND EXCESSIVE MINING </h1>
  </div>

  <h3> Why is it bad? </h3>
  <p>Illegal and Excessive Mining are one of the major causes of climate change caused by human activities in this present world. It negatively affects many factors in the society such as peace, stability, security, development, governance, the rule of law, the environment and the economy. Illegal mining leads to several crimes such as fraud, smuggling, and corruption.</p>

  <h3> Examples of Illegal Mining in present-times </h3>
  <p>The Philippines faces a lot of major issues caused by Illegal Mining. There are several mountain and cliffs that are illegally mined by several companies. It made to the headlines that issues about Illegal Mining during the past 6 years. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) faced many challenges, hearings, and trials, just for the illegal activities come to a stop. </p>

  <h3> How to help on preventing and avoiding Illegal Mining. </h3>
  <p> One thing we can do is identify the areas that would most likely be subjected to illegal mining. Through this, we would know which areas to protect and the government would be able to take the necessary measures for solving this problem. </p>
  
  <p> Another thing that we can do is spread information as well through social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. This can be done by creating infographics, posters, and simple posts, it would be better if the content would not be wordy (since others may find the post dragging). Doing this would give other people a chance to learn the effects of illegal mining and give them the sufficient knowledge that may be used to combat illegal mining in our planet.  </p>
